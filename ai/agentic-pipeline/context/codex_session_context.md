It manages the complete registration lifecycleâ€”from capturing customer details and validating inputs, to persisting records in a relational database, and exposing CRUD operations through a REST API. The system is designed to integrate with enterprise authentication and authorization frameworks, ensuring compliance with data security policies. It also establishes a foundation for downstream processes such as customer profile enrichment, service eligibility checks, and integration with external systems.

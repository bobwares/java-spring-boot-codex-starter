## Metadata Header

— Every source, test, and IAC file must begin with Metadata Header comment section.
- exclude pom.xml
- Placement: Top of file, above any import or code statements.
- Version: Increment only when the file contents change.
- Date: UTC timestamp of the most recent change.


### Metadata Header Template
    ```markdown
      /**
      * App: {{Application Name}}
      * Package: {{package}}
      * File: {{file name}}
      * Version: semantic versioning starting at 0.1.0
      * Turns: append {{turn number}} list when created or updated.
      * Author: {{author}}
      * Date: {{YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ}}
      * Exports: {{ exported functions, types, and variables.}}
      * Description: documentate the function of the class or function. Document each
      *              method or function in the file.
      */
    ````

### Source Versioning Rules

      * Use **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
      * Start at **0.1.0**; update only when code or configuration changes.
      * Update the version in the source file if it is updated during a turn.

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

### Purpose

The adr.md` folder captures **concise, high-signal Architecture Decision Records** whenever the
AI coding agent (or a human) makes a non-obvious technical or architectural choice.
Storing ADRs keeps the project’s architectural rationale transparent and allows reviewers to
understand **why** a particular path was taken without trawling through commit history or code
comments.

### When the Agent Must Create an ADR

### Minimal ADR Template

```markdown
# {{ADR Title}}

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated

**Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

**Context**  
Briefly explain the problem or decision context.

**Decision**  
State the choice that was made.

**Consequences**  
List the trade-offs and implications (positive and negative).  
```

Understood. Here’s the finalized **AGENTS.md snippet** with the `codex/turn-{{turn-id}}` naming convention:

---

# Branch Naming Convention

Each Codex **turn** must create a new Git branch at the start of execution. The branch name format is:

```
codex/turn-{{turn-id}}
```

Where:

* `codex/turn-` is the fixed prefix.
* `{{turn-id}}` is the integer identifier for the turn, incremented by 1 at the start of each turn.

### Rules

1. The `{{turn-id}}` must match the ID recorded in `/turns/index.csv`.
2. The branch must be created before any artifacts are committed.
3. All commits for the duration of the turn must go to this branch.
4. The branch name must be logged in both the turn’s **changelog** and the **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**.
5. At the end of the turn, the branch may be merged via PR in line with repository policy.

### Example

* Turn ID: `12`
* Resulting branch:

  ```
  codex/turn-12
  ```
